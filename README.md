# portal Website


This is a part of a group project conducted for Software Engineering course.



# Overview

This project aimed to create a website with capabilities of having several UI's (Views) for Admins and Students respectivily.
Using Node js and Postgress SQL, Backend is fully developed with a lot of innerjoins with the database. I tried to upload all the project files into this thread.
Frontend however, isn't developed properly without any Css nor any kind of advanced GUI, such as React js.
